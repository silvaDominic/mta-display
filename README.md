# mta-widget

A widget for displaying NYC subway train times for various lines.

## Purpose

The goal of this project was to implement
the [case study design](https://www.adamfishercox.com/portfolio/countdown-clocks-for-the-mta/) of the MTA display
banners conducted by the designer Adam Fisher-Cox. I found the designs compelling and a welcome change and improvement
to the somewhat crude and antiquated design of the existing displays. An initial web based implementation and proof of
concept will lead into a React Native or native Android implementation that can then be utilized in a physical display.
Where it goes from there is undetermined, but at the very least I plan on building my own display with this design and
detailing my experience.

## Concept

To summarize Adam's designs, the redesign offers to display more arrival time data at once and in a more intuitive and
modern way, utilizing rounded 'cards', larger fonts, arrows, and animations. It does lack total parity with the current
design though which leaves room for improvement.
